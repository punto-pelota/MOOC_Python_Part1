  <p align="left">
    Hi! My name is Julia, and in this repository I will share my projects that I will be doing in MOOC Python course from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki. 
  </p>
  
  <p align="left">
      It is not my first attempt to learn to code and I can't tell that I am a complete newbie in coding (I have some experience with automating tests with Selenium WebDriver and Java. But my learnings were always unstructured and random, so with this course I would like to make everything differently and document my learning process here. 
      
  </p>

  <p align="left">
    I decided not to start from the very beginning and started with a task where I got the first message from the code validator. It was "Food Expenditure" exercise in Part 1 Chapter 4.

## About Me

Some information about myself in addition to my Linkedin profile:
I am from Ukraine currently living in Barcelona. 
I speak English and German (full working proficiency) and Spanish at an intermediate level (B1+). 
In 2010 I graduated from a faculty of Foreign Languages where I studied translation from English and German.
After that I worked as a translator for 1 year where I travelled to Europe and Asia to work as an interpreter at machinery exhibitions (China, Taiwan, Germany, Austria). 
But soon I understood that I would like to develop technical skills, because I saw how AI tools were evolving and understood that only knowing foreign languages it not enough. 

With that, in 2011 I started working as a Customer Care agent at company Gameloft. 
The next career path you can check on my Linkedin page, but in short I: 

* completed a QA Engineering course and got a job as a QA Engineer in a database company testing SQL queries in PL/SQL and T-SQL
* worked for a Swiss startup for auditors proofreading content in three languages, running regression tests and maintaining project documentation up-to-date which was crucial for this project with 2 week sprints 
* transitioned to a QA Engineer position at EPAM Systems where after passing an internal course, I switched to a Business Analyst role because I wanted to improve the process in our SCRUM team and saw this opportunity. With my transition to this role and preparing the backlog in advance and adding clear acceptance criteria to user stories, our team was able to achieve 100% of predictability. Often there was even free time to support other teams who needed additional resources.

Currently I am working as a QA Manager for a big company in Barcelona. I am in charge of:
* test strategy
* QA related training materials 
* review of test plans
* creating test data
* support with tools for testing (SonarQube, BrowserStack)
* presentations and leading events
* promoting quality culture

Why am I learning programming? Because I would like to work with data in a more efficient way and automate repetitive tasks.
As someone who enjoys working with data, I think that Python will help me develop my skills in data analytics.
